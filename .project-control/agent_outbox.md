### 2026-02-12 21:10 - Fix profit breakdown zeros on home
- Root cause: /api/analytics did not robustly detect operation type when `operation_type` was absent or numeric.
- Updated `src/routes.ts`:
  - use `operation_type ?? type` as source,
  - normalize matching by string/upper/numeric id,
  - added `taxTypeIds` fallback,
  - added text fallback checks for coupon/dividend/commission/tax,
  - kept analytics soft-fallback behavior.
- Updated `src/ui/homePage.ts`: cache key bumped to `home_portfolio_cache_v7` to invalidate stale cached breakdown.
- Validation: `npm test` passed (`check-project-control`, `check-encoding`, tests).
### 2026-02-12 21:35 - Fix overstated payout cards
- Tightened operation classification in `src/routes.ts`:
  - coupon/dividend/commission now use enum names/ids only,
  - tax uses enum ids + TAX-type name match only.
- Updated dividend forecast aggregation:
  - ignore cancelled dividend events (`dividend_type` contains `cancel`),
  - skip non-positive dividend amounts.
- This reduces false-positive matches that were inflating:
  - `receivedDividends12` card,
  - `incomeNext12` card.
- Validation: `npm test` passed (project-control, encoding, tests).
### 2026-02-12 22:00 - Profit scoped to current holdings since purchase
- Updated `src/routes.ts` profit aggregation logic.
- Added current portfolio instrument sets (`figi`, `instrument_uid`).
- Added first pass over operations to detect earliest buy timestamp per current instrument.
- Profit components now include only operations that:
  - belong to current portfolio instruments, and
  - are dated on/after first buy date for that instrument.
- Applied scope to coupon/dividend/commission/tax parts of profit formula.
- Kept `receivedDividendOps` collection for dividends chart separate from scoped profit accumulation.
- Validation: `npm test` passed.
### 2026-02-12 22:20 - Coupons from sold/redeemed assets in profit + Project Control language fix
- Updated `src/routes.ts`: `couponsIncome` now counts actually received coupon operations regardless of whether the asset is still in current portfolio.
- Kept portfolio-scope filter for other profit components unchanged.
- Restored Russian text in Project Control tasks that had switched to English/garbled text.
### 2026-02-12 22:45 - Home movers redesign (no tabs)
- Updated `src/ui/homePage.ts` movers section:
  - removed tab switcher and heading "ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",
  - added two side-by-side blocks: "ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½" and "ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½".
- Updated JS rendering:
  - removed `activeTab`, `tabUp`, `tabDown`, and tab click handlers,
  - added `renderMoverList()` and independent rendering for up/down lists.
- Added responsive behavior: movers columns collapse to one column on narrow screens.
- Validation: `npm test` passed.

### 2026-02-12 21:37 - Rework home profit to lifetime PnL
- Updated `src/routes.ts` (`/api/analytics`) profit formula to lifetime model:
  - `profit = current_value + sells + coupons + dividends - buys - commissions - payout_taxes`.
- Added new profit breakdown fields from API:
  - `currentValueRub`, `buysRub`, `sellsRub` (kept existing coupon/dividend/commission/tax fields).
- Removed current-holdings-only filter from profit accumulation so sold assets and historical operations are included.
- Limited tax deduction in this KPI to dividend/coupon tax operations.
- Updated `src/ui/homePage.ts`:
  - profit tooltip now shows current value, sells, buys, coupons, dividends, commissions, payout taxes,
  - client state/cache updated for new breakdown fields,
  - cache key bumped to `home_portfolio_cache_v8`.
- Validation: `npm test` passed (`check-project-control`, `check-encoding`, tests).

### 2026-02-12 19:10 - Fix profit and future payouts using full operations history
- Root cause: /api/analytics used GetOperations and was capped at 1000 operations, causing distorted profit and payout filters.
- Updated src/grpc.ts: added GetOperationsByCursor typing for operations client.
- Updated src/routes.ts (/api/analytics):
  - switched operations loading to paginated GetOperationsByCursor (limit 1000, cursor loop),
  - kept fallback to GetOperations if cursor method is unavailable,
  - profit now uses complete operation history (trades/income/fees/taxes).
- Verified with live account request: profitRub is 41 795.23 RUB; incomeNext12 total is 37 437.60 RUB.
- Validation: npm test passed.

### 2026-02-12 22:13 - Fix BOM handling for .project-control/data.json
- Updated scripts/check-project-control.ts to strip UTF-8 BOM before JSON.parse.
- Added auto-heal: when BOM is detected, file is rewritten without BOM.
- Verified by forcing BOM into data.json and running npm run check:project-control (passes).
- Validation: npm test passed.


### 2026-02-12 22:18 - Guard against inflated profit values
- Updated src/routes.ts: added deduplication of operations by stable key (id or composite) when collecting history via GetOperationsByCursor/fallback GetOperations.
- Updated src/ui/homePage.ts: hardened parseNumberFromText for unicode minus (?, –, —) and mixed locale separators.
- Bumped home cache key to home_portfolio_cache_v10 to drop stale inflated values from localStorage.
- Validation: 
pm test passed.


### 2026-02-12 22:23 - Fix dead buttons on home page
- Root cause: invalid TypeScript syntax leaked into browser script (let normalized: string;) inside enderHomePage() output, causing JS parse error and stopping all event handlers.
- Updated src/ui/homePage.ts in parseNumberFromText():
  - replaced let normalized: string; with valid JS let normalized;,
  - normalized minus characters with unicode escapes ([\u2212\u2013\u2014]).
- Validation: generated home script parses successfully (m.Script) and 
pm test passes.


### 2026-02-12 22:28 - Fix zero KPI breakdown/future payouts regression
- Updated src/routes.ts:
  - if GetOperationsByCursor throws, backend now falls back to GetOperations instead of zeroing operation-based metrics,
  - added numeric analytics fields: profitValue, profitBreakdown.{currentValue,tradesNet,coupons,dividends,commissions,taxes},
  - added numeric alue to incomeNext12 and eceivedDividends12.
- Updated src/ui/homePage.ts:
  - switched to numeric fields first (string parsing only as fallback),
  - mapMonthSeries now uses ow.value when available,
  - bumped cache key to home_portfolio_cache_v11.
- Validation: /api/analytics returns non-zero numeric breakdown and future payouts; 
pm test passed.
